    <h2></h2>
    <p> Aloha! My name is Adam. I am currently pursuing a Bachelors Degree in Applied
        Business Management. I am studying part-time online through the BYU Pathways
        program at BYU-I and I have a full time job as a Site Supervisor for a Construction
        Company called Power Tools Plus.</p>

    <p> I am married and have nine children/step children and two grandchildren. My wife and I
        have formed a blended familv. I am from Hawaii and currentlv live in Australia. My wife
        and I also sing in a duo called SIK-AS at local events and clubs around where we live and
        our children are also musical and join in when appropriate. I am a member of the Church
        of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and have been my entire life and currently serve on
        the Branch Presidency as the First Cousellor in our Local Branch. </p>

    <p>I am studying to better myself. If I obtain more gainful employment or further my
        knowledge I see this as an advantage. It also pertains to my favorite talk by Elder Dallin
        H. Oaks which is "Good, Better, Best". He Teaches us in this address that there are some
        things that are good and then there are some things that are better but, there are also those
        thing which are best those thing are that in which we shoul pursue. I believe that
        obtaining my degree now is one of those Best things. </p>
